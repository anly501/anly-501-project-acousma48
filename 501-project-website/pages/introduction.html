My topic is the development trend of new energy industry in the United States in recent years. In recent years, with the increasing awareness of environmental protection and the development of new energy technology, the new energy industry is at an unprecedented height. However, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors, the development of new energy industry also has certain resistance. My project focuses on investigating the representative large multinational companies in the new energy industry, and making a certain degree of prediction of the future of the new energy industry based on the company's performance and other information.
